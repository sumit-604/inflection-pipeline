# screens/ — the shallow funnel

Where screener hits get a one-page read before anyone spends a full `/step1`
on them. Not the deep pipeline. A card says what the company does, the
transition management claims, the growth triggers with dates, whether the
numbers back it, what is missing, and a `/step1` verdict with the load-bearing
facts a deep run must verify first.

- `cards/<TICKER>.md` — one card per company, rewritten on each read.
- `corpus/<TICKER>/` — the documents themselves, held on disk, with a
  `MANIFEST.md` per company and a `.txt` beside every PDF carrying
  `===== PAGE n =====` markers so a card can cite a page you can open.

## The rule, after 2026-09-06

A card is written from documents held in `corpus/`. Cloud search is for
finding which documents exist and where; it is not the source of a card's
numbers. "Not found" on a card means not in the corpus, and the card says
where it was looked for.

## How the corpus is built

| Document | Source | Tool |
|---|---|---|
| Annual reports, concall transcripts, presentations, Financials.xlsx | screener.in, with the operator's login | `tools/collector/screener_collect.py <url> --output-dir <folder> --no-drive` |
| Credit-rating rationales | Agency pages linked from screener.in's Credit ratings block, no login | `tools/collector/fetch_ratings.py <url> --output-dir <folder>` |
| Credit-rating letters filed with the exchange | BSE announcement PDFs, no login | same script |
| Quarterly results, filings, and any document Bull AI indexes | `https://docs.bull-ai.in/d/<code>` serves the original PDF, no call cost | plain download; codes come from Bull AI search or chunk results |
| Quarterly results and filings Bull AI lacks | BSE announcements API (`AnnSubCategoryGetData/w`, `strCat=Result` or `-1`, with a bseindia Referer header) | plain download of `xml-data/corpfiling/AttachLive/<attachment>`; if that returns an 8 KB error page, the same name under `AttachHis/` serves it |
| India Ratings and Acuité "connect" pages | script shells; a plain fetch gets nothing | render in the browser, save the text |

Screener.in address quirk: ASM Technologies lives at its BSE code,
`/company/526433/`, not at its symbol. Try the symbol, fall back to the code.

## The three cloud services, honestly

| | Trendlyne MCP | Bull AI MCP | Local corpus |
|---|---|---|---|
| File on disk | no | no, but its links serve the PDF | yes |
| Page numbers | no | yes | yes |
| Knows what it holds | no | yes, free to ask | n/a |
| Credit ratings | no | no | yes |
| Budget | 400 calls/day | 100 calls/month on the current plan; searches and page reads count, availability and usage do not | your login and tokens |

Coverage seen on small caps: both services lagged on annual reports (FY25
only for Valiant and Ruby on Bull AI; screener.in had FY26 for all three),
neither had a transcript for Valiant or Ruby (none exist), and Bull AI's OCR
garbles financial tables, which is one more reason to hold the PDF.

## First run, 2026-09-06

Three operator picks from the Trendlyne 52-week-high and top-gainers screens:
VALIANTLAB, ASMTEC, RUBYMILLS, all under 150% year to date. Cards were first
written from Trendlyne snippets, then Bull AI snippets, then rewritten from the
held corpus. The corpus: 39 documents, about 1,650 PDF pages, both latest
quarterly results per company, the latest annual report per company, every
concall that exists, and credit ratings from CRISIL, ICRA, Acuité and India
Ratings. Bull AI calls used: 18 of 100.

Known gaps in the corpus: Valiant's IPO-proceeds monitoring report of August
2026 (Bull AI's link was empty; fetchable from the BSE archive path); ASM's
June-2026 result PDF is a scanned image (the quarter's numbers are taken from
the company's June-quarter presentation, which is held). Every other document
in the operator's list is on disk.
